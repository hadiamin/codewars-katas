# Codewars Katas

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), a platform for practicing and improving your programming skills by solving code challenges.

## About Codewars

Codewars is a community-driven platform that provides a fun and challenging way to learn and improve your coding skills. The challenges, also know as katas, are grouped by difficulty level and cover a wide range of programming languages and topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised by programming language, with each language having its own folder. Within each folder, the solutions grouped by kata and include the kata name and level in the file name. For example:

python/
├── 8-kyu/
│   ├── even_or_odd.py
│   └── sum_of_positive.py
└── 6-kyu/
    └── convert_string_to_camel_case.py

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to have the appropriate programming language and any necessary dependencies installed on your machine. Each solution file includes a brief description of the kata and the problem it solves. along with the solution code.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions have passed the tests on Codewars, they may not be the most efficient or elegant soution possible. They are simply my own attempts at solving the challenges and should be used for reference or learning purpose only
